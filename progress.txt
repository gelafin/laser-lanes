add check for end of game
  - if all allies (or enemies, can check either) have a dead opposite ship, count living allies vs living enemies and decide result
  - add simple alert for victory

properly laser images
  - size lasers (may need to update url for enemy lasers, since Flikr changed it for ally ones)
  - invert ally lasers
  - pls shrink input box; it only needs to fit 20 chars (use em plus max-width: %)

start screen
  - popup with an explanation of the game and a start button
  - start button: removes the popup and starts the first tick (will need to move setup of setInterval(tick...) into button c/b, as well as bg music)

add input dictionary check
  - when exactly to check? 1 second after input stops?
  - what to do if it's not a word? Just delete it all? Gray font and let lasers pass through? Lose a life?

add incoming laser images to Ship
