add check for end of game
  - in componentDidMount, remove tick() interval

deactivate winning ships

properly laser images
  - size lasers (may need to update url for enemy lasers, since Flikr changed it for ally ones)
  - invert ally lasers
  - pls shrink input box; it only needs to fit 20 chars (use em plus max-width: %)

start screen
  - make an actual popup and blur bg, not just alert
  - start button: removes the popup and starts the first tick (will need to move setup of setInterval(tick...) into button c/b, as well as bg music)

add input dictionary check
  - when exactly to check? 1 second after input stops?
  - what to do if it's not a word? Just delete it all? Gray font and let lasers pass through? Lose a life?

add incoming laser images to Ship
