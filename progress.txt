! FIX
  - sometimes, enemy (only enemy) charging does not advance to firing until the NEXT tick
  - independently, sometimes, dead enemy (only enemy) is chosen to charge
    - confirmed it's not always removed from state array

add check for end of game
  - if all allies (or enemies, can check either) have a dead opposite ship, count living allies vs living enemies and decide result

add incoming laser images to Ship

size lasers (may need to update url for enemy lasers, since Flikr changed it for ally ones)
