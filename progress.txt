refactored advanceShipState and Game.state[ship object arrays]
  -> ship object arrays are now keyed by ID
    -> Fix: they're actually arrays of objects keyed by id. Need to use reduce() or something.
      -> easier for constructor to just use lane numbers as keys (don't know ID until after ship object is created), but easier elsewhere to key by ID
        -> just move it to componentDidMount(), to make ship object and then add it to the object and then add it to state?
